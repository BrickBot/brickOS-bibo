-----------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT USAGE NOTES
 * XS memory requirements may dictate use of a reduced kernel.  Back in
   the BrickOS 0.2.6.10 XS implementation, creator Taiichi Yuasa
   recommended disabling the following configurations:
    - CONF_SETJMP
    - CONF_LR_HANDLER
    - CONF_RCX_MESSAGE
    - CONF_VIEW_BUTTON
   In newer kernels, disabling the following is also recommended:
    - CONF_DCC
 * XS will function without CONF_ASCII; however, "puts" and "putc"
   functionality will be limited.  Without CONF_ASCII defined, puts
   will always display "ASCII" and putc will dispaly a '-' in the
   specified position.
    - It appears XS putc and even puts could perhaps be adapted to
      be supported via putc_native, which does not require ASCII
 * For autonomous programs, the demo program rover-watcher is suggested
   as a starting point for testing basic, autonomous XS programming.

XS was originally written for a slightly modified version of
brickOS-0.2.6; effort to bring XS up to the mainstream version was
undertaken by Matthew Sheets.

XS executables:

	xs: gcc -o xs -DJOINT -DONLINE front.c
		The evaluator is linked with the frontend,
		i.e., xs behaves as an ordinary Lisp system.

	xs-host: gcc -o xs-host front.c
		The frontend generates input code to be embedded in
		the evaluator running on Unix.
		The generated code is stored in file "xsout-host".

	eval-host: gcc -o eval-host eval.c
		The evaluator runs on Unix, by executing the code generated by xs-host.
		The code in "xsout-host" is #include'd in the source of the evaluation.
		Therefore, remake eval-host each time "xsout-host" is created.

	xs-rcx: gcc -o xs-rcx -DRCX front.c
		The frontend generates input code to be embedded in
		the evaluator running on RCX.
		The generated code is stored in file "xsout-rcx".

	eval-rcx.lx: h8300-gcc -DRCX eval.c
		The evaluator runs on RCX, by executing the code generated by xs-rcx.
		The code in "xsout-rcx" is #include'd in the source of the evaluation.
		Therefore, remake eval-rcx.lx each time "xsout-rcx" is created.

	xs-ir: gcc -o xs-ir -DRCX -DIRCOM -DONLINE front.c
		The frontend communicates with the RCX evaluator through the
		IR port.

	eval-ir.lx: h8300-gcc -DRCX -DIRCOM -DONLINE eval.c
		The evaluator runs on RCX, by communicating with the frontend
		through the IR port.

	The preprocessor macros have the following meanings:
	
		RCX: The evaluator runs on the RCX.
		JOINT: The evaluator is linked with the frontend.
		IRCOM: The frontend commuicates with the evaluator
		       through the IR port.
		ONLINE: The frontend can receive messages from the evaluator.
