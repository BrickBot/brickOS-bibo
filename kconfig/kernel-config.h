/*! \brief  Kernel-Specific Configuration File
 */
/*  
 *  This kernel-specific configuration file should ONLY #define or #undef
 *    differences compared to the primary, standard include/config.h file.
 *  The file in the root "kconfig" directory exist ONLY as a template.
 *
 *  For creating a kernel-specific configuration:
 *   (1) Create a subdirectory given the same name as the kernel
 *   (2) Create a copy of this kernel-config.h file in that subdirectory
 *   (3) Edit that file to include the #define or #undef differences
 *         from the primary, standard include/config.h file.
